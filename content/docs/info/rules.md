1. First and foremost, this server is a place for people to have fun, build cool things, and enjoy themselves
2. Treat everyone with respect. Harassment, bullying, and hateful language will not be tolerated.
3. Discrimination or hate speech of any kind based on race, gender identity, sexuality, or other immutable characteristics will not be tolerated.
4. Do not spam the chat with repetitive messages, caps, or unnecessary links.
5. Keep public discussions relevant and respectful to avoid disrupting the experience for others.
6. Don't destroy or excessively modify the landscape (i.e. burning down and entire forest or demolishing a mountain) unless it's part of the server's gameplay.
7. Work together to maintain a clean and enjoyable world for everyone
8. Griefing (destroying or altering someone else's builds without permission) is strictly prohibited.
9. Respect others' creations and only modify areas where you've been granted permission.
10. Respect others' chests, items, and resources. Do not take anything not in communal chests without permissions.
11. Always ask before borrowing anything from another player.
12. The use of hacks, cheats, mods, or exploits to gain an unfair advantage is prohibited
13. Violations of these rules will result in punitive actions at the discretion of server staff including, but not limited to:
    - Warnings
    - Muting
    - (In-game) Jail time
    - Temporary Suspension
    - Banning
14. If you encounter any problems or violations, please report them to a server staff member rather than taking matters into your own hands.
15. False reporting or misuse of the reporting system will be treated seriously and harshly.

ImportedReality and designated staff members are the sole arbiters of who is in violation of the rules.
