This server is intended to be a Vanilla+ server. Mods that introduce new recipes, gameplay mechanics, etc. will be kept to an absolute minimum

## Server-Side Mods

The server is running the following mods:

- Auto Whitelist Remove
- ChunkyBorder
- Copper Items
- CoreProtect
- EssentialsX
- EssentialsX Chat
- EssentialsX Spawn
- LuckPerms
- Squaremap
- Vault
- ViaBackwards
- ViaVersion

If enough players request a specific mod, it will be taken into consideration.

## Client-Side Mods

Feel free to install any client-side mods you like as long as it does not introduce any cheats/exploits. Map mops like Xaero's and Journey map are fine as this isn't intended to be a hardcore/competitive server.

If you are looking for suggestions, I am personally a fan of the [Immersed with Shaders](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/immersed-with-shaders) mod pack. It is highly recommended that you use a third-party launcher such as 

**I WILL NOT DEBUG ANY COMPATIBILITY ISSUES WITH ANY MODS INSTALLED ON YOUR CLIENT**

## Resource Packs

Currently the server does not provide any resource packs as I view that as a matter of personal taste. I personally like to use and recommend the [DefaultHD](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/default-hd) resource pack.
