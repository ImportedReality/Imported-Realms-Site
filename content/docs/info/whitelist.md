In order to ensure a quality experience for players, this server is whitelist-only. 

{{< callout type="info" >}}
There are currently **75** whitelist slots available.
{{< /callout >}}

Apply to the whitelist [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScIpC5ZFEZLrZnIIZy6blEkP7Q9E0n432X5uyXqoagm-qdlSQ/viewform?usp=header)

## Wait Time

Responses to the application form are checked *at most* once a day. If you would like to be notified when you are added to the server or if the server is currently full, please provide your email or bluesky username in the relevant question on the application form.

## Waitlist

If the whitelist is full when you apply, you will be notified if contact information was provided and added to a waitlist. As spots free up in the whitelist, users from the waitlist will be added in a First-In-First-Out basis.

## Inactivity

To keep inactive players from taking up slots in the whitelist that could be utilized by a more active player, anybody that has not been active on the server for 3 months will be automatically removed from the whitelist.

Once removed from the whitelist, any items owned by the player will be moved into a chest in the event they are re-added to the whitelist. Any builds made by the player will be left in-place but will not be protected.
