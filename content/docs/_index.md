ðŸ‘‹ Hello! Welcome to the ImportedRealms documentation!

## Overview

Imported Realms is a Minecraft Java server running on PaperMC 1.24.1. It is running ViaVersion and ViaBackwards so it should be compatible with any client version >= 1.19.x, updating your client should not break compatibility.

For now it is just a Vanilla+ Survival server, but more mods may be added in the future if enough interest is shown. 

This server has a total of 50 slots which will be allocated on a first-come-first-serve basis. In order to ensure the server remains active, players that have not logged in in the past 3 months will be removed from the whitelist.
