The world is a 5k radius circle, centered on a ringed-mountain topped with a cherry tree grove. It's a decent sized world with a good variety of biomes so players are encouraged to explore and build to their hearts content.

The spawn is in a small welcome center in the cherry grove ring. The center ring is intended to be a central communal location for players to come back to if needed and trade with other players.

I plan to keep this world around for a while, but if enough players want request it I can make a new world. If/when that happens there will be an announcement and a request to seed suggestions followed by a vote.
