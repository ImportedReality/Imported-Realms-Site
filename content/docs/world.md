The world is a 5k radius circle, centered on a ringed-mountain topped with a cherry tree grove. It's a decent sized world with a good variety of biomes so players are encouraged to explore and build to their hearts content.

Aside from making a small building as a welcome area, a farm, and a tunnel breaching the North side of the Ring the world is completely untouched and ready for exploration!

To start with, there is a 5k world border just to ensure the world doesn't take up too much disk space, but if there is a need to explore further and the world isn't too large the border will be lifted.

The spawn is in a small welcome center in the cherry grove ring. The center ring is intended to be a central communal location for players to come back to if needed and trade with other players.

The plan is to keep this world around for a while, but if enough players ask I can make a new world. If/when that happens there will be an announcement and a request for seed suggestions followed by a vote.
